    <h1>Tractors</h1>

    <hr>
    <p>
        A tractor is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow
        speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery such as that used in agriculture, mining or
        construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to
        mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, but nowadays a great variety of tasks.
        Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source
        of power if the implement is mechanised.

    <hr>
    <h3>Traction engines</h3>
    <p>
        The first powered farm implements in the early 19th century were portable engines – steam engines on wheels that
        could be used to drive mechanical farm machinery by way of a flexible belt. Richard Trevithick designed the
        first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a "barn engine" in 1812, and it was
        used to drive a corn threshing machine.[5] The truly portable engine was invented in 1893 by William Tuxford of
        Boston, Lincolnshire who started manufacture of an engine built around a locomotive-style boiler with horizontal
        smoke tubes. A large flywheel was mounted on the crankshaft, and a stout leather belt was used to transfer the
        drive to the equipment being driven. In the 1850s, John Fowler used a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine to
        drive apparatus in the first public demonstrations of the application of cable haulage to cultivation.

        In parallel with the early portable engine development, many engineers attempted to make them self-propelled –
        the fore-runners of the traction engine. In most cases this was achieved by fitting a sprocket on the end of the
        crankshaft, and running a chain from this to a larger sprocket on the rear axle. These experiments met with
        mixed success.[6] The first proper traction engine, in the form recognisable today, was developed in 1859 when
        British engineer Thomas Aveling modified a Clayton & Shuttleworth portable engine, which had to be hauled from
        job to job by horses, into a self-propelled one. The alteration was made by fitting a long driving chain between
        the crankshaft and the rear axle.[7]

    <h3>Gasoline and kerosene</h3>
    <p>
        Since the turn of the 20th century, internal combustion engines have been the power source of choice. Between
        1900 and 1960, gasoline was the predominant fuel, with kerosene (the Rumely Oil Pull was the most notable of
        this kind) and ethanol being common alternatives. Generally, one engine could burn any of those, although cold
        starting was easiest on gasoline. Often, a small auxiliary fuel tank was available to hold gasoline for cold
        starting and warm-up, while the main fuel tank held whatever fuel was most convenient or least expensive for the
        particular farmer. In the United Kingdom, a gasoline-kerosene engine is known as a petrol-paraffin engine.
